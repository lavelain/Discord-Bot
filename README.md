You'll have to import your own node modules in

You will also have to make your own .env file with the following entries

You can put Discord into Developer mode to enable copying of IDs

DISCORD_TOKEN (Your Discord Devleoper Bot Token)

PREFIX (Whatever symbol you'd like to preceed your command, I'd suggest ! or /)

LAVEID (Server Owner role ID)

MODID (Mod role ID)

TESTCHANNEL (A channel you can comment in, in some areas,  to test new commands before pushing to live)

JOINROLE (join role default ID)

JOINCHANNEL (Channel where post will go ID)
